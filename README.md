# OOPL-Phone-Number-Guesser
The Phone Number Guesser project aims to develop a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to:
Easily input a phone number and receive instant feedback on the corresponding country based on its country code.
Automatically validate and clean the input by removing non-numeric characters, ensuring that only proper phone numbers are processed.
Utilize an organized data structure to manage country codes efficiently, facilitating quick lookups and reliable results.
By providing a straightforward, intuitive application, this project seeks to enhance users' ability to navigate international communication, thus reducing confusion and errors related to phone number identification.
